/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * holography — the projection kernel: how a *type* scopes to a resource.
 *
 * A holographic projector reads a boundary resource (a path + its content) into
 * carried items of some type `T`, and writes them back. A type is DEFINED BY
 * these morphisms (Yoneda), not by a folder or a spec. The codecs specialize
 * this kernel; each supplies its own `T` and its own recognize/read/write.
 *
 * Restriction is done HERE, in code — no `restricting/` directory.
 * `restrict(parent, …)` composes a child whose recognition ENTAILS the
 * parent's (`recognize_child = recognize_parent ∧ local`): a Curry–Howard
 * entailment edge. read/write inherit from the parent unless overridden, so
 * carrier-bearing behavior appears exactly at the node that owns it.
 *
 * Generic over the carried type `T`: this module imports nothing.
 *
 * This package has no action-face module: there is no `src/running` here,
 * and this kernel does not implement an action boundary. CLI/HTTP/OpenAPI/MCP/
 * form/witness faces live elsewhere, in the (unrelated) `relating` package.
 * This module stays purely representation-facing — how a type scopes to a
 * resource — not the process loop users run.
