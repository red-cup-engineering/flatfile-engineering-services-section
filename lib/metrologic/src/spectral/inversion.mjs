// inversion.mjs — the spectral inversion duality z ↦ 1/z, over our integers.
//
// The conjugate roots of a substitution's characteristic polynomial sit somewhere relative to the unit
// circle, and "where" is not a foreign stability question — it is the inversion duality z ↦ 1/z, the same
// duality the system already runs:
//   • Verdier (verdier.mjs) duals the morphism by transpose (Mᵀ) — H¹ ≅ H₁;
//   • the Anderson–Putnam colimit (colimStructure) makes ×M invertible, so M⁻¹ acts on the limit, and
//     char-poly(M⁻¹) is the RECIPROCAL polynomial p*(z) = zⁿ·p(1/z) — the coefficients reversed.
// So z ↦ 1/z (roots inside ↔ outside) is the colimit's own inversion, read on the polynomial.
//
// Two morphisms here, both pure integer (no roots ever computed, no division):
//   • `reciprocal` — the inversion dual p ↦ p* (reverse the coefficients), an involution.
//   • the SELF-DUAL / ON-CIRCLE locus — p shares a root with its dual p* iff `resultant(p, p*) = 0`
//     (the Sylvester determinant vanishes). That shared-root set is the inversion-symmetric part of the
//     spectrum (reciprocal pairs and unit-circle roots) — the spectral analog of the Klein gauge's
//     self-dual fixed set {⊤, ⊥} (gauge.mjs). Pisot ⟺ this locus is empty (one root strictly broke the
//     duality outward, none neutral on the circle).
//
// A polynomial is a list of our integers (number/integer), low→high, normalized (no high zero padding).
// Built over our ℤ — slow but honest; scale is a downstream (computer/) concern.
