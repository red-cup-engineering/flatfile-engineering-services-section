**A charge → style/readout utility — the FOUR place classification a renderer needs, and a validated replacement for the hand-rolled switch statement, on zero dependencies.**

## The model

`place(charge)` reads a charge's FOUR place using the bilattice's own vocabulary (`charge.mjs`'s header comment): `absurd` `[F,F]`, `potential` `[T,F]`, `active` `[F,T]`, `stable` `[T,T]`.

`knowledgeWeight(charge)` is the knowledge order's own measure of "how determined" — 0 (absurd), 1 (potential or active — the knowledge order ties them), 2 (stable).

`salience(charge)` is a **total** draw-priority ranking, derived rather than picked by hand: `knowledgeWeight × 2 + (pos ? 1 : 0)`. Knowledge breaks the place apart first; truth (the `pos` bit) breaks the tie the knowledge order leaves between `potential` and `active`. This reproduces exactly the ordering `absurd < active < potential < stable` that two legacy consumers (`abrash`, `tsander`) each hand-rolled as `{BOT:0, F:1, T:2, TOP:3}` — confirming the ordering was already theory-shaped, just not derived.

`styleFor(charge, table)` replaces a hand-rolled per-place switch/keyed-object (as `abrash`'s `WALL_COLOR` and `tsander`'s `CHARGE_GLYPH` each were) with one validated lookup: `table` must cover all four `PLACES`, checked up front by `assertStyleTable`.

This package deliberately does **not** ship any consumer's colors or glyphs — only the theory-derived classification and ordering a style table is looked up by. What a `potential` cell looks like is a rendering decision each consumer still makes; which FOUR place a charge is in, and where it ranks, is not.

## Install & run

Zero dependencies, ESM only, Node ≥ 20.

```sh
node --test
```

## Usage

```js
import { place, salience, styleFor } from "@lenticule-science/metrologic/readout";

const WALL_COLOR = { absurd: "grey", potential: "green", active: "darkred", stable: "yellow" };
styleFor(charge, WALL_COLOR); // one lookup, validated, instead of a switch on charge.value
```
