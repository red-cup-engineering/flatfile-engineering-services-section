# @lenticule-science/metrologic/number

**The number tower — ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, and the exact integer-matrix layer — constructed out of the articulated space, on `@lenticule-science/metrologic/{bilattice,chu}`.**

This package re-derives the numbers on the floor's own carriers — the bilattice charge and its Chu face — NOT on an imported set theory.
Each level is the level above it read through one more face of the same structure.

## ℕ — the positive extension of a membership claim (von Neumann)

A natural number is the positive **extension** of a membership claim: the tokens whose membership, once **settled**, lands at `t`.
Nothing is seeded — there is no empty box to start from (the floor forbids it: `articulate([])` is malformed, a value is measured, never stamped).
In particular **zero is REACHED, not seeded**: articulate the boundary token's membership and settle it OFF `t` — told both member and not-member, the knowledge-meet reaches `⊥` (the floor's own `[false,false]`), so the claim settles and nothing lands at `t`.
The empty extension is a *result of settling*, not a primitive `∅`.

- `successor n` — settle one more token to `t`: the open boundary `n` becomes a member, a new boundary opens.
  Taken von Neumann, `n`'s members are `{0,…,n−1}`.
- the value of `n` is the size of its `t`-extension, read back through the floor's Chu space (`asExtension` / `extensionOf`).

Numbers are interned (one object per value), so equality is object identity.
That interning is a cache over the settled content, not the content.

## ℤ — the charge's two-sided evidence, read as a difference

The floor's charge tracks two sides at once — positive evidence and negative evidence — and `negate` (the truth involution) interchanges them.
An **integer** is exactly that two-sidedness read as a **difference**: a pair `(pos, neg)` of naturals standing for `pos − neg`.

- `negate` (swap the two sides) **is the additive inverse**: `−(p, m) = (m, p)`.
- addition accumulates each side separately (transverse aggregation).
- **zero is REACHED by balance**, not seeded: `x + (−x)` cancels — told a thing and its opposite equally, the difference is nothing.
  Every balanced pair `(k, k)` is the one integer zero.

Built on ℕ (the sides are counts, so accumulation genuinely adds); canonicalised by cancelling the smaller side (monus) so one side is `0`.

## ℚ — ratios (the multiplicative two-sidedness + the residual ⊸)

A rational is a ratio of integers `num/den` (`den ≠ 0`), carrying several faces at once:

- **multiplicative two-sidedness** — `num` and `den` are the two sides, mirroring ℤ's additive two-sidedness one level up.
  `reciprocal` (swap `num ↔ den`) **is the multiplicative inverse**, and the unit `1` is REACHED by balance `a/a`, just as ℤ's `0` is reached by additive balance.
- the **residual ⊸** — division `a/b` is the residual the floor names but had not built; `divide` is its first concrete instance on numbers, and `reciprocal(x) = 1 ⊸ x`.
- the **additive face** rides up in the numerator (ℤ's reached zero and `negate` carry up unchanged).

Built on ℤ (hence ℕ): equality is cross-multiplication `a·d = b·c`, canonicalised by gcd-reduction with `den > 0`.

## The exact integer-matrix layer over ℤ

Integer matrices over our integers — exact, no host arithmetic, no imported linear-algebra package:

- `determinant` — cofactor expansion over ℤ.
- `charPoly` — `det(λI − M)`, the same cofactor expansion instantiated over `ℤ[λ]`; coefficients low→high, monic.
- `smithNormalForm` — integer row/column reduction driven by the gcd (using our ℤ truncated division); `M` and `Mᵀ` always share these invariant factors.
- `rank` — the number of nonzero invariant factors (= rank over ℚ, no field division needed).

> Migrated OUT of the playground (`math/playground/src/number/`) once the tower fully settled.
> The playground keeps thin re-export shims onto this package, so a single interned-carrier instance is shared across both.

## Install

A private workspace package (Node ≥ 20, ESM only).
From the repo root:

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Usage

```js
import * as N from "@lenticule-science/metrologic/number/natural";
import * as Z from "@lenticule-science/metrologic/number/integer";
import * as Q from "@lenticule-science/metrologic/number/rational";
import * as M from "@lenticule-science/metrologic/number/matrix";

N.toCount(N.add(N.fromCount(2), N.fromCount(3)));        // → 5
Z.toInt(Z.negate(Z.fromInt(4)));                         // → −4   (negate = swap the two sides)
Q.toNumber(Q.divide(Q.fromRatio(1, 2), Q.fromRatio(3, 4))); // → (1/2)/(3/4)   (the residual ⊸)
M.rank(M.fromInts([[1, 1], [1, 1]]));                    // → 1
```

The whole tower is also available from the barrel as namespaced members:

```js
import { natural, integer, rational, matrix } from "@lenticule-science/metrologic/number";
```

## API (by module)

- `natural` — `zero`, `one`, `successor`, `predecessor`, `add`, `multiply`, `monus`, `divmod`, `gcd`, `leq`/`less`/`compare`/`isMember`, `asExtension`/`extensionOf`, `toCount`/`fromCount`.
- `integer` — `integer`, `fromNatural`, `negate`, `add`/`subtract`/`multiply`, `divmod`/`quotient`/ `divides`, `sign`/`magnitude`/`compare`, `equivalent`, `toInt`/`fromInt`.
- `rational` — `rational`, `fromInteger`, `reciprocal`, `divide`, `add`/`subtract`/`multiply`/`negate`, `sign`/`compare`, `fromInt`/`fromRatio`/`toNumber`.
- `matrix` — `determinant`, `charPoly`, `smithNormalForm`, `rank`, `transpose`, `matmul`, `matEqual`, `fromInts`.

## Testing

```sh
pnpm test            # node --test
```

Tests are law-style: the Peano and commutative-semiring laws for ℕ (with extension-size and settling-depth pinned through the floor); the commutative-ring laws and reached-by-balance zero for ℤ; the field laws, the reached-by-balance unit, and the residual for ℚ; and the matrix invariants (determinant, `det(λI − M)`, Smith normal form, rank, transpose-invariance) against hand computation.
