/**
 * article â€” the news-document production surface: the voice-parameterized
 * article prompt, the structured-reply parser, story selection from an
 * intake, and the mechanical editorial gates.
 *
 * This is the news specialization of document production â€” the sibling of
 * ./documentation (documents about CODE) turned on NEWS. It is pure over
 * its inputs: the prompt is built from a voice value and a source story,
 * the reply is parsed, the draft is gated. The I/O (calling the model,
 * fetching the intake, writing the candidate, recording the run) belongs
 * to the cycle that owns it â€” content-farm â€” exactly as documentation's
 * I/O belongs to its app. News âŠ‚ document âŠ‚ content: the parse/gate
 * primitives live here in the content library, beside the doc ones, never
 * in the service.
 *
 * Following documentation.mts's discipline, the source story enters as a
 * structural subset (`SourceStory`), so this module never depends on the
 * intake transport (syndication-codecs); the cycle passes its richer items
 * in and `selectStory` returns them unchanged via the element type.
