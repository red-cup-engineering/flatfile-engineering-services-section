/**
 * copyedit â€” local editorial closure operators: provenance-preserving
 * endomorphisms on a draft body that REMOVE form defects without an LLM.
 *
 * Each operator is the deterministic DUAL of a detection primitive in
 * gates.mts. Where `prophecyFindings` LOCATES a certainty-about-the-future
 * sentence, `deprophesy` REWRITES its modal into the hedged form the craft
 * law requires. Where `repetitionFindings` LOCATES a repeated sentence,
 * `dedupe` DROPS the later copies. Where `lint()` LOCATES a wordy/passive
 * span carrying a concrete `suggest`, `applyLintSuggestions` SPLICES it in.
 * Where a quoted title was altered, `restoreTitles` RESTORES the witnessed
 * source title exactly. A detector finds the defect; its dual removes it.
 *
 * The operators are confined to the publishable INTERIOR â€” open prose â€”
 * and never touch the protected substrate: quoted source titles (link
 * text), URLs, headings, code, or front matter (see `protectedSpans`).
 * That confinement is what makes the closure faithfulness-safe: it can
 * only undo defects the writer introduced, never invent evidence, numbers,
 * or sources. Length-reducing operators (`dedupe`) are GUARDED by a word
 * floor, so the closure is gate-monotone: it never flips a passing length
 * gate to failing.
 *
 * Composed to a fixpoint, they are `copyedit`: a closure operator on a
 * draft's form-defect set. The closure laws â€” idempotence, defect-
 * monotonicity, faithfulness â€” are not asserted here; they are TESTED in
 * copyedit.test.mts, per the topology-law discipline: a process is not
 * called topological unless the laws actually hold on real input.
 *
 * This is the first editorial endomorphism of the fiber algebra of
 * production: `copyEdit` as an idempotent, provenance-preserving
 * endomorphism (fiber-algebra-editorial-production memo, Â§6). Its named
 * successors are `settlement` (a contested claim published as attributed/
 * disputed rather than dropped) and `publicationInterior` (the surface
 * projection that lets a publication be a thin config over the mill) â€”
 * the other operators the same algebra is meant to carry.
