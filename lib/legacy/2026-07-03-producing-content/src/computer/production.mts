/**
 * production — the content domain's compute layer over the carriers of

 *
 * Two morphisms:
 *
 * - `meetDemandWithSupply` — demand meets supply in the lattice sense: an
 *   assignment is created only over the demanded terms that the supplied
 *   intake actually supports. Every demanded term receives a judgment —
 *   a support witness carrying its supplying items and evidence, or an
 *   obstruction (invariant A1: judgments are carriers, never booleans).
 *
 * - `runProductionCycle` — the draft → judge → revise cycle. The ask and
 *   the gates enter as VALUES; the result is a witness-or-obstruction
 *   carrier whose rounds are an append-only trace ordered by stage
 *   ordinals, never by wall-clock.
