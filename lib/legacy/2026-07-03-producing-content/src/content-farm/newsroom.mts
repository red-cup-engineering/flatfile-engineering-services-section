/**
 * newsroom — the NEWSROOM FIBER over the content-farm cycle.
 *
 * Per emsenn (2026-06-15): "newsroom is meant to be a specialization of
 * content-farm, where its special functions are parameters into a content-farm."
 * This module harvests those special functions out of the (retiring) standalone
 * `@emsenn/newsroom` package and exposes them as content-farm SEAM parameters —
 * `select`/`compose`/`record` — so a newsroom is literally
 * `cultivate(property, { ...options, ...newsroomProfile })`, not a parallel
 * engine. See dev/docs/notes/2026-06-15-newsroom-as-fiber-over-content-farm.md.
 *
 * This file currently carries the COMPOSE seam (multi-paper brief synthesis,
 * the newsroom reporter's voice); the SELECT seam (angle clustering) and the
 * RECORD seam (claim-state assertion trace) fold in next. The synthesis
 * functions are kept exported in their own right — they are real capabilities
 * (grounded multi-source briefing) and must not be lost.
