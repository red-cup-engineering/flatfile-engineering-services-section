 *
 *   potential â€” witnessed movement aligned with the telos, none against
 *   active    â€” witnessed movement against the telos, none aligned
 *   stable    â€” movement both ways: a held contradiction, kept with receipts

 * Movement is computed exactly: the effect trace folds into a demand
 * charge over the telos target's term space, and each target term's
 * realized sign is compared with its intended sign.
