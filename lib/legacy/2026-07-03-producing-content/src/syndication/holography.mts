// @emsenn/syndication-holography â€” projects SyndicationItem into
// ClaimStateBundle form so news-algebra can work with syndicated content.
//
// Syndication is downstream of content and upstream of news. This lib is the
// bridge: it takes a decoded syndication item and produces the canonical wire
// resource (ClaimStateBundle) that news-algebra operates on.
//
// All claims carry force "alleges" and status "supported": a wire reports
// what a source says; it does not confirm, compute, or endorse.
