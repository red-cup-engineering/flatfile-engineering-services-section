/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * `@red-cup-engineering/witness-journal-coherence` computes the coherence
 * judgement between two wire-form readings of the same witness (or ordered
 * witness log): a "reading" is the Leader's sense of the word — a settled
 * judgement computed over witnesses, not a field stored anywhere — and two
 * readings cohere when both are lossless round-trips AND hopping through
 * either one to reach the other and back returns to the same witness pivot.
 *
 * The round-trip mechanics themselves (is this one reading an isomorphism at
 * all?) are generic and live in `@red-cup-engineering/wire-form-round-trip-check`;
 * this package is the witness-journal-domain judgement built on top of them.
 * Extracted from `@red-cup-engineering/agentic-relation-engine`'s ledger module, where the two
 * were fused in one file.
