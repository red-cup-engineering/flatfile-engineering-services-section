/**
 * predicating/independent-evidence — the predication-charge machinery, reseated.
 *
 * A Fregean predication fixes ONE oriented (subject, predicate, object) point;
 * evidence FOR it and evidence AGAINST it are independent `Bool × Bool`
 * coordinates — relational converse and subject/object reversal are never
 * denial. This is the executable form of
 * `Obsmetrologia.Language.Predicating.FregeanFourChu`
 * (obsmetrological-services-section/lib/obsmetrologia/Obsmetrologia/Language/Predicating/FregeanFourChu.lean):
 * `independentEvidenceCharge : Bool × Bool -> Charge` is exactly
 * `independentEvidenceRow`/`independentEvidenceSide` feeding `foldIndependentEvidence`'s
 * per-cell join, and `predicationChu` is exactly what `sectionSpace` presents —
 * predications as points, witnessing parties as states, the FOUR-valued read as
 * the matrix entry. See `teaching-articles/explanations/independent-evidence.md`
 * for the full grounding (also the CHL/nuclear-quartet reading and glass-sponge
 * §16.4's "independence is evidential, not organizational").
 *
 * Ported from `@red-cup-engineering/computer`'s `posix-holography/src/substrate.mjs`
 * (a read-only deprecation inventory as of this port — write nothing there).
 * That module built this on top of the general `fold`/`settle`/`supersede`/
 * `relate` OS substrate (any predicate, any trace, functional or relational).
 * This port carries ONLY the independent-evidence family: `foldIndependentEvidence`
 * below is a self-contained fold restricted to claims seeded at ⊥ plus rows whose
 * side is resolved by `independentEvidenceSide` — it does not open the legacy
 * `opts.converse` remap (refused, as in the original) and, unlike the original's
 * shared `fold`, does not scan the trace for incidental `has-converse`
 * declarations either — a predication-charge fold has no path by which converse
 * can define denial. Both real consumers of the original (workspace-content-graph,
 * fae) only ever called it without that legacy path live, so this narrowing
 * changes no observed behavior; it just closes a door the function's own
 * doc comment already said should not exist.
 *
 * Row admission, identity, and grouping use the operational EAVT owner.
 * The independent evidence fold remains scientific; nothing here is
 * reimplemented: `foldIndependentEvidence` joins per-cell evidence with
 * `positing/bilattice-charge`'s `joinKnowledge`, and `sectionSpace` presents the
 * folded fiber as an explicit Chu space over FOUR via
 * `positing/logic/linear-logic-chu` — this package's own executable form of
 * `Obsmetrologia/Calculus/Logic/LinearLogicChu.lean`.
