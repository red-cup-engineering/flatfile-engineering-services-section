/**
 * notation — Relation Model Notation (RMN)'s admission gate: the closed,
 * well-typed-term decidability boundary, and its extension to HTML documents
 * and message-stream sessions.
 *
 * The package admits only closed, well-typed core terms at this boundary, then
 * settles them with the package evaluator. That gives the codec a concrete
 * decidable admission gate for executable JSON content. It is deliberately not
 * an arbitrary JavaScript execution boundary, and this package does not currently
 * claim a formal Lean strong-normalization proof for the evaluator's whole
 * domain extension.
 *
 * This is the gauge behind "an HTML document may carry a program and stay
 * decidable": admit `<script type="application/rmn+json">` only when the script
 * body is a closed, well-typed RMN term, and reject every other script type. The
 * document then carries its data, its markup, and its morphism — everything but
 * the interpreter itself.
 *
 * NOTE (scoping, not yet acted on): `extractRelationalScripts`/`htmlIsRelational`/
 * `settleRelationalHtml` and `sessionIsRelational`/`settleRelationalSession` are
 * application-boundary logic (how a web document or a session admits RMN
 * content), not notation — per the operator's "an RMN services section needs
 * codecs and an evaluator, nothing else," these arguably don't belong in this
 * section at all. Flagged, not moved: no established home for them was found
 * yet. `isRelationalTerm`/`parseRmn`/`settleRmn` (the bare admission gate) stay
 * here regardless, composing typing + the reducer.
 *
 * The named-variable surface syntax (`compileNamedRmn`/`parseNamedRmn`/
 * `namedString`/`namedArray`/`namedObject`/`namedBool`/`namedGenerator`/
 * `namedOfCompiled`/`canonicalNamedRmn`/`digestNamedRmn`) has moved to its own
 * package, `@red-cup-engineering/relation-model-notation-named-codec`, under
 * `relation-model-notation-codecs-services-section` — it is a codec (named
 * surface ↔ de-Bruijn `Tm`), this package is the admission gate; they were
 * bundled together before this split, which is exactly the "several functions,
 * several packages" scoping error being corrected.
 *
 * Transcribed from metroplat's `src/lib/language/reader/index.mts`, behavior
 * preserved exactly (TypeScript type annotations dropped; JSDoc typedefs
 * substituted). `evaluate` now comes from
 * `@red-cup-engineering/relation-model-notation-eval` in place of the relative
 * `../eval/index.mts`; `inferTy`/`isClosed` now come from
 * `@red-cup-engineering/relation-model-notation-typing` in place of the
 * relative `../check/index.mts`.
 *
 * `parse` now comes from `@red-cup-engineering/json-codec-service`, a
 * real published package, differentially verified identical to metroplat's
 * copy for what this package needs — no remaining dependency on metroplat
 * anywhere in this package.
